In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first choice**\n",
    "Gaussian Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real workd applications:**\n",
    "The GNB was used a lot in text classification, such as email spam/not spam examples, because it works pretty well with word frequencies in the text [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strenghts**\n",
    "It's very useful for categorical type data, it's also good because it might be not to sensitive to outliers, since it works with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknessess**\n",
    "Because the algorithm is based on probability theory, he's very dependant on the data distribution, so in datasets with sparse data (more of a given class than other), the algorithm might not succeed well.\n",
    "And also the Gaussian NB does not have too many hiper-parameters, making a GridSearchCV kind of useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Good Candidate **\n",
    "The data given has a lot of categorical type data, this makes a NB approach a good candidate for his type of dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "** The second choice: **\n",
    "Support Vector Machines Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world applications:**\n",
    "A lot of applications used SVM paired with HoG based features for image classification [2], it worked very well until the early deep CNN based image classifiers started to be viable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strenghts**\n",
    "SVMs are good for both linear an non linear classifications. It also shows good Accuracy, and works well on smaller cleaner datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknessess**\n",
    "Isnâ€™t suited to larger datasets as the training time with SVMs can be high, and in counter part with the Naive Bayes it's less effective on noisier datasets with overlapping classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Good Candidate **\n",
    "The dataset is small, with 300 training points, and 90/100 test points tops.\n",
    "\n",
    "** The third choice **\n",
    "Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "** Real world Applications **\n",
    "It was used on college admissions data on this research [3]. It's wildly used in many other things, since it's a statistical model, it's not exclusive to the machine learning community.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Strenghts **\n",
    "Wildly used to solve multiple problems, simple to use, and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Weakness **\n",
    "Very simple, and it's bad agaisnt attributes that are unrelated to the output variable as well as attributes that are very similar (correlated) to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Good Candidate **\n",
    "The attributes are not really correlated, and the data is small, and not too noisy. \n",
    "And also the study in [3] shown good results, in a very similar context, with similar data.\n",
